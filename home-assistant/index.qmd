## Home Assistant üöß
Home Assistant (HA) could be the best smart home solution for any technical proficient person who creates an unique home automation experience for family. A couple of key features include:
- One-app to control it all with both official and custom integrations with various smart home products (Tuya, Sonoff, Xiaomi, WLED) and software (Telegram, OpenAI, iOS widgets, Android Text-to-speech)
- Customisable dashboards to do home automations or view sensor data (presence, energy used, robot vacuum cleaning path) with options to display different buttons for different users

However, HA may not be suitable for non-technical people as it requires coding knowledge (yaml, python) and can be a huge time-sink for anyone. If you are up for the challenge to create your HA smart home setup, feel free to check out its [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/) and some docs/learnings/resources I plan to write / have written below and have fun playing with HA!
